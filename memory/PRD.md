# Vocably — Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build a production-quality, mobile-first English vocabulary learning platform for school
students, English learners, and competitive-exam/test-prep students worldwide. Core loop:
DISCOVER → UNDERSTAND → RECALL → USE → REVIEW → MASTER. Personalized journeys based on
level, goals, exams, study time, performance, mistakes, review history and mastery.

## Platform / Architecture
- Frontend: Expo (React Native) + TypeScript, expo-router, @tanstack/react-query.
- Backend: FastAPI + MongoDB (Motor). Opaque Bearer session tokens (7-day, TTL index).
- Auth: Email/password (bcrypt) + Emergent-managed Google OAuth.
- AI: planned via GPT-5.6 Luna through Emergent Universal key (Phase 5).
- Theme: warm light "premium education" (Sage green accent), Plus Jakarta Sans, Phosphor-style MDI icons.

## User Personas
- School student building curriculum vocabulary.
- Test-prep student (IELTS/TOEFL/GRE/SAT/GMAT) with an exam date and target.
- General English learner (CEFR A1–C2) improving everyday/academic vocabulary.

## Core Requirements (static)
- Personalized daily mission; adaptive spaced review; multi-mode practice.
- Structured (normalized) word metadata + knowledge graph relations.
- Progress, streaks, XP, achievements; entitlement (free/pro) foundation.
- Fast, calm, uncluttered UX; loading/empty/error states everywhere.

## Implemented (2026-09-29)
- **Phase 1 — Foundation:** Auth (email + Google), root auth gate, bottom tabs (Home/Learn/Exams/Discover/Profile), design system (theme tokens, Button/Card/Chip/Input/Icon/ProgressRing/Skeleton/Toast/CefrBadge), Mongo schema + indexes, seed content (20 words, 6 topics, 6 exams), user profile.
- **Phase 2 — Vocabulary engine:** Word list with search + CEFR/topic/exam filters + pagination, Word detail page with knowledge graph (synonyms/antonyms/related), save/unsave, saved list, daily mission generator.
- **Phase 3 — Practice + review:** Session player (teach card + multiple_choice / synonym / true_false / spelling / fill_blank), deterministic SM-2-style adaptive review (mastery/confidence/next_review/status NEW→SEEN→LEARNING→RECALLING→MASTERED), XP + streak, Progress screen (learned/mastered/accuracy/level/weak areas), achievements.
- **Exam Hub (partial):** exam list, exam detail with countdown/target/words-per-day/mastery progress, set-as-goal, exam-scoped practice.
- **Analytics events** logged server-side (onboarding, session start/complete, word viewed/saved, answer submitted, word mastered).

## Backlog (prioritized)
- **P0:** Expand canonical word bank (seed synonyms as real headwords so graph chips are all tappable); more words per exam/topic.
- **P1:** AI features (explanations, mnemonics, example generation, quiz gen, reading passages) via Emergent key; Read & Learn; Learn From Anything (PDF/image/text extraction).
- **P1:** Audio pronunciation (US/UK) + audio caching.
- **P2:** Full entitlement/paywall + IAP (RevenueCat), offline packs/sync, admin content system, PYQ system, school/curriculum system, leaderboards, SEO web.

## Next Tasks
1. Grow vocabulary content and cross-link the knowledge graph.
2. Add AI-powered word explanations and example generation.
3. Add pronunciation audio.
4. Build the paywall + Pro entitlement gating.
